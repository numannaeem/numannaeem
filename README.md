### hi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Numan - a 21 year-old CS Engineering student, and an aspiring web developer. I'm from Kerala ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, but spent most of my life in Saudi Arabia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦. To know more, check out my [portfolio](https://numxn.me)!

I've created a bunch of small projects to improve and polish my skills; feel free to scour through my profile to check them out. It's almost exclusively web dev stuff, mostly using React and NodeJS.

#### about my work ðŸ“–
- ðŸŒŸ My favourite project is [NumChess](https://github.com/numannaeem/num-chess). Check it out if you're into chess!
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning NextJS, Firebase, and Android app development.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my portfolio website, and a number of mini projects, mostly for college.

#### few not-so-fun facts âš¡

- I love playing and watching chess (although admittingly I'm not very good at it). Just hit me up if you ever wanna play a game.
- I enjoy watching football, and Bayern Munich is my favourite team.
- Dark is the greatest TV series of all time in my opinion. If you're into sci-fi shows and haven't watched it yet, you're missing out!
- I listen to a lot of music, and my taste is very diverse. But if I had to pick a favourite artist, it would be [Eden](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1t20wYnTiAT0Bs7H1hv9Wt).
