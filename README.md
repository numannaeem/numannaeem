#### few not-so-fun facts ⚡

- I love playing and watching chess (although admittingly I'm not very good at it). Just hit me up if you ever wanna play a game.
- I enjoy watching football, and Bayern Munich is my favourite team.
- Dark is the greatest TV series of all time in my opinion. If you're into sci-fi shows and haven't watched it yet, you're missing out!
- I listen to a lot of music, and my taste is very diverse. But I'm a diehard [_The Strokes_](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0epOFNiUfyON9EYx7Tpr6V) fan.
