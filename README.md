### നമസ്കാരം | hey there 👋
I'm Numan - a 21 year old CS Engineering student, and an aspiring web developer. I'm from Kerala 🇮🇳, but spent most of my life in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦.

I've created a bunch of small projects to improve and polish my skills; feel free to scour through my profile to check them out. It's almost exclusively web dev stuff, mostly using React and NodeJS.

#### about my work 📖
- 🌟 My favourite project is [NumChess](https://github.com/numannaeem/num-chess). Check it out if you're into chess!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning NextJS, Firebase, and Android app development.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on my portfolio website, and a number of mini projects, mostly for college.

#### few not-so-fun facts ⚡

- I love playing and watching chess (although admittingly I'm not very good at it). Just hit me up if you ever wanna play a game.
- My favourite football club is Bayern Munich ❤️ Not big on cricket, but I do enjoy the Indian Premier League.
- Dark is my all-time favourite TV series. If you're into sci-fi shows and haven't watched it yet, you're honestly missing out.
- I listen to a lot of music, and my taste is very diverse. But if I had to pick a favourite artist, it would be [Eden](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1t20wYnTiAT0Bs7H1hv9Wt).
